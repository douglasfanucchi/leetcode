<p>
  The pre-order traversal of a Binary Tree is a traversal technique that starts
  at the tree's root node and visits nodes in the following order:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Current node</li>
  <li>Left subtree</li>
  <li>Right subtree</li>
</ol>
<p>
  Given a non-empty array of integers representing the pre-order traversal of a
  Binary Search Tree (BST), write a function that creates the relevant BST and
  returns its root node.
</p>
<p>
  The input array will contain the values of BST nodes in the order in which
  these nodes would be visited with a pre-order traversal.
</p>
<p>
  Each <span>BST</span> node has an integer <span>value</span>, a
  <span>left</span> child node, and a <span>right</span> child node. A node is
  said to be a valid <span>BST</span> node if and only if it satisfies the BST
  property: its <span>value</span> is strictly greater than the values of every
  node to its left; its <span>value</span> is less than or equal to the values
  of every node to its right; and its children nodes are either valid
  <span>BST</span> nodes themselves or <span>None</span> / <span>null</span>.
