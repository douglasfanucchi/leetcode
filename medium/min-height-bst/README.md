<p>
  Write a function that takes in a non-empty sorted array of distinct integers,
  constructs a BST from the integers, and returns the root of the BST.
</p>
<p>
  The function should minimize the height of the BST.
</p>
<p>
  You've been provided with a <span>BST</span> class that you'll have to use to
  construct the BST.
</p>
<p>
  Each <span>BST</span> node has an integer <span>value</span>, a
  <span>left</span> child node, and a <span>right</span> child node. A node is
  said to be a valid <span>BST</span> node if and only if it satisfies the BST
  property: its <span>value</span> is strictly greater than the values of every
  node to its left; its <span>value</span> is less than or equal to the values
  of every node to its right; and its children nodes are either valid
  <span>BST</span> nodes themselves or <span>None</span> / <span>null</span>.
</p>
<p>
  A BST is valid if and only if all of its nodes are valid
  <span>BST</span> nodes.
</p>
<p>
  Note that the <span>BST</span> class already has an <span>insert</span> method
  which you can use if you want.

<h3>Sample Input</h3>
<pre><span class="CodeEditor-promptParameter">array</span> = [1, 2, 5, 7, 10, 13, 14, 15, 22]

<h3>Sample Output</h3>
<pre>         10

<span class="CodeEditor-promptComment">// This is one example of a BST with min height</span>
<span class="CodeEditor-promptComment">// that you could create from the input array.</span>
<span class="CodeEditor-promptComment">// You could create other BSTs with min height</span>
<span class="CodeEditor-promptComment">// from the same array; for example:</span>
         10

      5      15
    /   \   /   \
