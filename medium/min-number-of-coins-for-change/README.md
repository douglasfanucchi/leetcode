<div class="html">
<p>
  Given an array of positive integers representing coin denominations and a
  single non-negative integer <span>n</span> representing a target amount of
  money, write a function that returns the smallest number of coins needed to
  make change for (to sum up to) that target amount using the given coin
  denominations.
</p>
<p>
  Note that you have access to an unlimited amount of coins. In other words, if
  the denominations are <span>[1, 5, 10]</span>, you have access to an unlimited
  amount of <span>1</span>s, <span>5</span>s, and <span>10</span>s.
</p>
<p>
  If it's impossible to make change for the target amount, return
  <span>-1</span>.
</p>
<h3>Sample Input</h3>
<pre><span class="CodeEditor-promptParameter">n</span> = 7
<span class="CodeEditor-promptParameter">denoms</span> = [1, 5, 10]
</pre>
<h3>Sample Output</h3>
<pre>3 <span class="CodeEditor-promptComment">// 2x1 + 1x5</span>
</pre>
