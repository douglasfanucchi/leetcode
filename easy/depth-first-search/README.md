<p>
  You're given a <span>Node</span> class that has a <span>name</span> and an
  array of optional <span>children</span> nodes. When put together, nodes form
  an acyclic tree-like structure.
</p>
<p>
  Implement the <span>depthFirstSearch</span> method on the
  <span>Node</span> class, which takes in an empty array, traverses the tree
  using the Depth-first Search approach (specifically navigating the tree from
  left to right), stores all of the nodes' names in the input array, and returns
  it.
</p>
<p>
  If you're unfamiliar with Depth-first Search, we recommend watching the
  Conceptual Overview section of this question's video explanation before
  starting to code.
