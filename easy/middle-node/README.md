<p>
  You're given a Linked List with at least one node. Write a function
  that returns the middle node of the Linked List. If there are two middle
  nodes (i.e. an even length list), your function should return the second
  of these nodes.
</p>

<p>
  Each <span>LinkedList</span> node has an integer <span>value</span> as well as
  a <span>next</span> node pointing to the next node in the list or to
  <span>None</span> / <span>null</span> if it's the tail of the list.
</p>

<h3>Sample Input</h3>
<pre><span class="CodeEditor-promptParameter">linkedList</span> = 2 -&gt; 7 -&gt; 3 -&gt; 5</pre>
<h3>Sample Output</h3>

<pre>3 -&gt; 5 <span class="CodeEditor-promptComment">// The middle could be 7 or 3,
// we return the second middle node</span></pre>
