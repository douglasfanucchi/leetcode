<p>
  Given an array of n integers, what is the maximum sum given by a subsequence?
</p>
<p>
  A subsequence of an array for this exercise is a set of numbers that are necessarily adjacent. For
  instance, the numbers <span>[1, 2, 3]</span> form a subsequence of the array
  <span>[1, 2, 3, 4]</span>, and so do the numbers <span>[3, 4]</span>. Note
  that a single number in an array and the array itself are both valid
  subsequences of the array.

<h3>Sample Input</h3>
<pre><span class="CodeEditor-promptParameter">array</span> = [3, 13, -10, 14, -20, 4, 15]
</pre>
<h3>Sample Output</h3>
<pre>20
</pre>
The output comes from the subsequence 
<pre>[3, 13, -10, 14]</pre>
