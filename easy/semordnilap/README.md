  Write a function that takes in a list of unique strings and returns a list of
  semordnilap pairs.
</p>
<p>
  A semordnilap pair is defined as a set of different strings where the reverse
  of one word is the same as the forward version of the other. For example the
  words "diaper" and "repaid" are a semordnilap pair, as are the words
  "palindromes" and "semordnilap".
</p>
<p>
  The order of the returned pairs and the order of the strings within each pair
  does not matter.
</p>
<h3>Sample Input</h3>
<pre><span class="CodeEditor-promptParameter">words</span> = ["diaper", "abc", "test", "cba", "repaid"]
</pre>
<h3>Sample Output</h3>
<pre>[["diaper", "repaid"], ["abc", "cba"]]</pre>
